I had to delete the original repository because I recently got a new Macbook pro, and as such, I forgot to set user.name and user.email for git. I had shown my full name to the world for about a minute.

This repository contains structs and other useful stuff to hack 64 bit Unity games on iOS. monoArray and monoString were written by caoyin. Included:

Included:
- A struct to represent a native C# array
- A struct to represent a C# string
- A struct to represent a List
- A struct to represent a Dictionary
- A function to make a C# string from a C string
- A function to create a native C# array with a starting length
- Some functions to get/set real values of Obscured types from Anti Cheat Toolkit (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/anti-cheat-toolkit-10395)

I will add more as I go so check back frequently!

To use, clone `Unity.h` into your project folder and `#include "Unity.h"`
